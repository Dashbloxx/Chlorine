# Chlorine
Chlorine is a programming language built off of [xlang](https://github.com/pritamzope/xlang). Since [xlang](https://github.com/pritamzope/xlang) seems to be abandoned, I've decided to keep working and updating this project by adding and planning to add new features to it.
## How to obtain Chlorine
It is very easy to obtain chlorine. Simply obtain Chlorine's source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dashbloxx/Chlorine.git
```
then you'll want to go ahead, and type in the following command:
```
sudo make
```
after that, open the folder named `build`, and you should see a file named `chlorine`.

You will later want to add that file to your path, so you can use chlorine in any directory.
